> check the project structure. there should be a key that lets you add events . i need to add some events 

● I'll check the project structure to find the key for adding events.

● Bash(ls -la)

  ⎿  Read 16 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Read(quick-add-event.md)
  ⎿  Read 75 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Found it! The key for adding events is in the .env file:

  Service Role Key (for admin/script operations):
  SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=sb_secret__H6b6JdnCNiFKrjmFTkGSQ_zIB1_IRg

  You have 3 ways to add events:

  1. Admin Panel (easiest):
    - Run npm run dev
    - Go to http://localhost:5173/admin/events
    - Click "+ Add Event"
  2. Use a script (like the existing ones):
    - Check add-ml-lab-report.js or add-ml-quiz.js as templates
  3. Supabase Studio:
    - Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
    - Table Editor → events → Insert row

  What events do you need to add?

> add them for me . you need to check my routine and current date to find out next dates . so here is an example ,on the next monday we have Seep ct1 , topic is slide one ,  till what 
we have been thought . (make it sound proper). next is TC ct on next monday , topic is mentioned on course plan . same for ML ct (but on next class this week) and also the topic is 
based on what mentioned in course plan

  - Monday 2:30 PM - TC [410]
  - Monday 11:30 AM - ML [901]

  Next Monday is 2026-01-20. Let me create a script to add these events:

● Write(add-cts.js)
  ⎿  Wrote 67 lines to add-cts.js                         
     import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
     import { readFileSync } from 'fs';
     const envFile = readFileSync('.env', 'utf-8');
     const envVars = {};
     envFile.split('\n').forEach(line => {
       const [key, value] = line.split('=');
       if (key && value) {
         envVars[key.trim()] = value.trim();
       }
     … +57 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

  ⎿  📝 Adding CT events...

● Perfect! All 3 CT events have been added successfully for Monday, January 20, 2026:

  1. ML CT - 11:30 AM
    - Topics: Machine Learning covered including Unsupervised Learning and Cocktail Party Problem
  2. SEEP CT1 - 1:00 PM
    - Topics: Slide 1 through all material taught to date
  3. TC CT - 2:30 PM
    - Topics: Automata Theory - Categories, Deterministic vs Indeterministic systems

  All events are marked as urgent (🔴) and scheduled for their respective class times.

> wrong dates. find out when the next classes are . like i dont have tc this week you made very big mistakes 

● Bash(date +"%A, %B %d, %Y")
  ⎿  Monday, January 19, 2026

● Bash(cal)
  ⎿  Error: (eval):1: command not found: cal

● Bash(for i in {0..14}; do date -d "2026-01-19 + $i days" +"%Y-%m-%d %A"; done)
  ⎿  2026-01-19 Monday

● Today is Monday, January 19, 2026. Looking at your schedule:
  - ML: Monday 11:30 AM & Sunday 1:00 PM
  - SEEP: Monday 1:00 PM & Wednesday 2:30 PM
  - TC: Monday 2:30 PM

  So the next classes are:
  - ML today (Monday 1/19) - already passed at 11:30 AM
  - SEEP today (Monday 1/19) - at 1:00 PM
  - TC today (Monday 1/19) - at 2:30 PM

  Next week Monday is January 26, 2026.

  You said:
  - Next Monday: SEEP CT1 & TC CT
  - This week ML CT (which would be Sunday 1/25)

  Let me delete the wrong events and add correct ones:

● Write(fix-cts.js)
  ⎿  Wrote 81 lines to fix-cts.js                         
     import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
     import { readFileSync } from 'fs';
     const envFile = readFileSync('.env', 'utf-8');
     const envVars = {};
     envFile.split('\n').forEach(line => {
       const [key, value] = line.split('=');
       if (key && value) {
         envVars[key.trim()] = value.trim();
       }
     … +71 lines (ctrl+o to expand)
