● I can see the conversation history where you:

  1. Successfully added TWP CT1 event for Tuesday, January 27, 2026 at 2:30 PM
  2. Created event-adding-rules.md with the complete workflow for adding events in the future

  The rules document includes:
  - How to check current date and find next class dates
  - Correct database schema with field names (name, description, date, time, type, subject, color)
  - Valid event types (ct, quiz, assignment, lab-report, exam)
  - Common mistakes to avoid
  - Step-by-step verification process

  Everything looks good! Is there something specific you'd like me to help you with now?

● I see ML Lab Report 2 is currently scheduled for Saturday, January 10, 2026 (which has already passed).

  You want it moved to next Saturday, which is January 24, 2026.

  Should I update the existing ML Lab Report 2 event to Saturday, January 24, 2026? What time and topic/description should it have?

> yes. no need for description

> alright . make sure to not create such mistakes in the future to write a guideline

● Update(event-adding-rules.md)
  ⎿  Updated event-adding-rules.md with 5 additions                                                                                                                    
       49    - ❌ Don't use wrong event_type values (will violate check constraint)
       50    - ❌ Don't use field names like `description` or `details` (use `info`)
       51    - ❌ Don't add events without verifying the class schedule first
       52 +  - ❌ **ALWAYS verify existing events before adding/updating**: Check if an event already exists with similar name to avoid duplicates or incorrect updates
       53 +  - ❌ **When user says "next Saturday" or similar**: Calculate from TODAY's date, not from an assumed date
       54 +  - ❌ **When updating events**: Always confirm the exact date with the user if there's any ambiguity
       55 +  - ❌ **Event corrections**: If user reports wrong dates, immediately check current events in database and fix them
       56 +  - ❌ **Date calculations**: When showing "tomorrow", verify what day "today" actually is first
       57    
       58    ### 7. Example Workflow
       59    

● Update(event-adding-rules.md)
  ⎿  Updated event-adding-rules.md with 5 additions and 4 removals                                                                                                 
        5    When asked to add events (CTs, quizzes, assignments, etc.), follow these steps:
        6    
        7    ### 1. Determine the Event Date
        8 -  - **Check the current date first**: Use `date` command to get today's date and day of the week
        9 -  - **Check the class schedule**: Run `node check-live-data.js` to see the routine
        8 +  - **ALWAYS check the current date FIRST**: Use `date +"%A, %B %d, %Y"` to get today's date and day of the week
        9 +  - **Check existing events**: Run `node check-live-data.js | grep -A 30 "📅 EVENTS"` to see what's already scheduled
       10 +  - **Check the class schedule**: Run `node check-live-data.js | grep -A 40 "📚 CLASSES"` to see the routine
       11    - **Calculate next occurrence**:
       12 -    - If the user says "next [day]", find the next occurrence of that day from today
       12 +    - If the user says "next [day]", find the next occurrence of that day from TODAY (not from an assumed date)
       13      - If the user says "this week", it means within the current week (Mon-Sun)
       14      - If the user says "next week", it means the following week
       15 -    - Generate a calendar for the next 2 weeks to identify the correct dates: `for i in {0..14}; do date -d "YYYY-MM-DD + $i days" +"%Y-%m-%d %A"; done`
       15 +    - Generate a calendar for the next 2 weeks using TODAY's date: `for i in {0..14}; do date -d "$(date +%Y-%m-%d) + $i days" +"%Y-%m-%d %A"; done`
       16    
       17    ### 2. Verify Class Time
       18    - Match the event time with the actual class time from the routine

● ✅ Updated event-adding-rules.md with stricter guidelines to prevent future mistakes:

  Key additions:
  1. ALWAYS check current date FIRST before any calculations
  2. Check existing events to avoid duplicates and verify what's scheduled
  3. Use TODAY's actual date for all date calculations, not assumed dates
  4. When user reports wrong dates, immediately verify and fix them
  5. Confirm ambiguous dates with the user before proceeding
